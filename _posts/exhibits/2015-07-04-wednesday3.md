Some notes I took down from the group crit about my work.

- the ideas aren't inherently clear through the way in which it is displayed now
- overwhelmed by the amount, but not so much in the content
- re-visitng the position and role of the camera
- colours used in an abstract way to break the series of different spaces apart from one another
- the grid layout is perhaps too generic
- to perhaps make the work more inherently obvious, that these came from security cameras. Rather than crop the screenshots so it is just the images instead leave the entire desktop of my computer. Then, with this printed on fake televisions or monitors it makes the process clearer but still with enough ambiguity to keep it from becoming literal.
