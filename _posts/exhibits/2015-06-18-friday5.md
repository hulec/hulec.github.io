I am trying to figure out what do do for my final presentation, and it is proving to be more difficult than I thought. One of the main things I have to address is the lack of wallspace, which limits the number of photographs that could be presented on my wall (potentially a good thing).

Having a single image on the wall is a "less is more approach", but it is also a gamble in the sense that this is all. To the viewer, their idea is that you (the artist) consider this your best image, and everything else which is in your research pile didn't make the cut. This means that the final image needs to be confident in standing by itself, and needs to have enough power and meaning to tie everything from this project together.
