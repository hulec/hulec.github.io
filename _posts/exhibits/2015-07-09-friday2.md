I have begun the process of printing out all of my surveillance images and cropping them manually. 

With four images per A4 sheet, I expect the printing is not only going to cost a fair amount, but it will take a while to print and then even longer to crop and stick onto the wall.

In regards to how they are going to be presented on the wall I am still in the process of working it out.
