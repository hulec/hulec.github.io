In trying to address the lack of fluidity in my previous experiment with security cameras, I have decided to return to some of my original ideas and concepts. 

Using the Richard Serra's _Verb List_ (1967–68) as a core and key driver for my experimentations, I am setting out to respond to as many of these verbs as possible (106 in total).
