_The idea_

As a reference back to the "Yellow car" game I used to play when I was still in primary school, the idea was to photograph all of the yellow cars in Point Chevalier, where I live.

Due to various circumstances I was busy on Thursday and needed to be in East Auckland the majority of the day. I had a 20 minute window of free time where I could go around and photograph yellow cars. In that time, I was only able to find 3 yellow cars and photograph them. I would like to pursue this idea further if I have the time.
