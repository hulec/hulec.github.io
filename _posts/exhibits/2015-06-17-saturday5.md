At this point in the project I am going with my contingency plan, and that is to have a single A0 sized photograph on the wall for my final presentation, alongside my research presented physically and as a video via this website.

I thought I would try and have one last laugh before hand-in. Choosing one of the photographs that I have already taken doesn't seem appropraite, given that they are taken from a larger sequence (the question is raised: _why did you choose this particular photograph over the others?_, etc). Those original images were strong (in my own opinion) because of the volume of them, presented through this sequential format. To break this would mean potentially weakening the images overall. Hence, I thought of trying a single one-off photograph.
