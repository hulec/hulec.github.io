Yesterday's feedback from the group was very helpful and much needed. I think my project could be pushed even further, and as Gavin mentioned it is important to constantly think of ways to break beyond the conventional presentation methods of photography (just sticking them on the wall) and go beyond. This means moving into other territories such as installation, sculpture and even toying with the idea of moving image.
