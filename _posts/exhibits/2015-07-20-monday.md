There were some interesting ideas and concepts discussed for the intorduction of this 208 photography project.

- notions of place and belonging shown through photography
- these words of place + belonging can be shown through a sequential format, but don't neccessarily have to be interpreted literally
- a place can either be from an immediate environment or somewhere else
- the mobility of exploring the space or a space through photography (chrono-photography)
- can be used for documentation, but also help to build notions of _types_ (an example being the "criminal" type, in being able to identify a criminal through their portrait and facial structure)
- mapping + charting through photography
- bringing social reform + change through photography
- in regards to belonging and place, who is the best to document this other than yourself?
