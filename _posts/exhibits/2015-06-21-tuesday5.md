One of my current ideas for presenting final work is through the construction of a zoetrope. Using a zoetrope would allow my photographs to remain in a sequential format, while also preventing it from becoming a static set of images. 
I am hoping to have this constructed and somehow mounted onto the wall, approximately 1.5 metres off the ground (the "standard height" for installation).
