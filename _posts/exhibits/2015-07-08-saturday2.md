Today, in between making work with the [IOWA Collective][iowa] I continued printing and cropping my images.

Choosing to have four images per sheet was a good decision, considering that it would have cost even more than what I have paid so far (approximately $25 in total). The thing that is costing the most now is the time taken to actually print all of these images and print them.

I thought at the start of today that I would easily finish printing everything and putting it up on the wall, but I as only able to do around 70% of what I intended.

This has turned out to be quite a labour intensive process.
