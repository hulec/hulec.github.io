##Thank you 

If you have gone through all/most of the documentation on this site and reached here, thank you.

After Monday I was more or less done with this project, with only my final print to do and some last minute research to complete.

All of the photographs taken, as well as any videos and text generated from this project are free to download and use for your own purposes. If you would like any raw files of the images/videos I took feel free to email me at [_hi@tomhackshaw.com_][mail]

Thanks to all the people who helped with this project. Thanks to Gavin Hipkins, Kaoru Kodama, Afreen Naoroji, the IOWA Collective, Rachel Ashby, Liza Savage, John Hodgson, my mom, my brother, and anyone else Iâ€™ve forgotten for all of your help and support during this project. 

Until the next project. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
Sincerely,
<br>
Tom Hackshaw.
