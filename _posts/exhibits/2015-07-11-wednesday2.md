#SECRET POWER

I indexed close to 60,000 IP unsecured security cameras located in Japan via the Internet, 400 of which I used to take photographs. Some were unsecured to the point where I could control the positioning of the camera. None of the images taken could be used to potentially identify someone, and does not feature people.

_Note_: **none** of these cameras had passwords on them, and were not secured in any way. Because of this, **I did not hack anything** to gain access into these cameras ("hacking" implies breaking into something that has been secured to keep intruders out). These cameras were public, and were accessing the same way in which someone visits an ordinary website.

- shodan.io for indexing
