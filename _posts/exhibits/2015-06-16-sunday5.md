As a very small experiment for research purposes, I thought of combining the oak tree photographs of Rodney Graham and the "straightened tree" photographs of Daniel Eatock.

Another final idea I had in mind (as well as my "pair" photograph) was to appropriate Graham's style, but instead of using trees use myself to _"illustrate a distinction between signifier and signified"_ (Graham). I would have my arms up, hair waxed to point upwards and my shirt also falling to reveal my stomach as though I was being suspended upside down.
