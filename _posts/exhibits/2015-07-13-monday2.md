One of the books I am reading in regards to this project is an e-flux journal called ***The Internet Does Not Exist*** (Julieta Aranda, Brian Kuan Wood, Anton Vidokle, 302.30285 A66). There are some interesting ideas in regards to how images interact online, what they do and how they evolve. The Internet, being as ubiqituous as it is, offer a near infinite number of images and is a global audience in which people can share, comment, modify and respond to uploaded material.

To play with this notion and perhaps facilitate external response via the Internet, I have licensed all of my photographs under a Creative Commons Zero license (ie into the public domain). This means that people can do whatever they want with my images, and they don't even need to seek my permission to do so. In doing this I am essentially relinquishing authorship over my photographs.
