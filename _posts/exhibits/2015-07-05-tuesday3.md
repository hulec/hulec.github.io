Trying to explore more deeply the ideas regarding my surveillance camera work.

As Gavin had said, the photographs I had taken could have been from anywhere. These become _heterotopian spaces_ (Michel Foucault, _Madness and Citizens_), a place where things are different, a collection whose members have few or no intelligible connections with one another.

As well as (trying to) reading Foucault, the current books I'm looking at are Fischli & Weiss (_Flowers and questions: a retrospective_, 759 F5299q; _Peter Fischli, David Weiss_, 759 F5299f; and _fotografias_, 759 F5299fo)
