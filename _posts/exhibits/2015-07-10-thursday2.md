I am trying to decide now how to print these photographs out. I would like to print all of them - I don't think just printing some out will have the same effect because of the power that can be achieved through the sheer volume of imagery.

Printing a single image per A4 sheet will cost too much and I cannot afford a lot for this project. Using images from contact sheets are too small and woul be too difficult in a logistical sense (easy to lose, hard ot put up and manoeuvre, etc).
