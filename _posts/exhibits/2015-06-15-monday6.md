Today was the group crit - the people who presented their work were (from memory, this might be the wrong order)

- Liza
- Rachel
- Bella
- Nicole
- Bronte
- Hannah
- Alice W.
- Lynn

It was fantastic to see the diversity of everyones work and the different presentation strategies. Although it is a bit late for me to do another U-turn now, it opened my ideas up as to how the reading of the work changes completely depending on the way it is presented, and it has the potential of making a work stronger or weaker as a result.
