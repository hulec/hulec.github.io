I am thinking of alternative ways in which I can present my photographs in a sequence. Looking at artists such as David Rokeby and Christian Boltanski, I thought of constructing a "conveyor belt" which continuously and automatically supplies imagery (idea borrowed from Boltanski's _Chance_ (2011), shown at the French Pavillion at the Venice Biennale).

The issue with creating a device of this complexity is the possible amount of time it will take. With less than two weeks left until hand in it seems unlikely that I could construct something like this.
