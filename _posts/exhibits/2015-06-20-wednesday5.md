I made two prototype models of a zoetrope as an experiment to see how effective the illusion is. 

These aren't made from the best materials, and there is no doubt that some of the measurements are far from exact. My concern is that even if I address these two things, the final result will look like a tacky hacked together thing that a 10 year old made in craft class.

Spinning these zoetropes doesn't seem to create much of an illusion. Traditionally zoetropes use simple black and white photographs or drawings that had blank backgrounds and exaggerated gestures, and as a result my photographs aren't entirely suitable for this format.

The current contingency plan is to stick to a more traditional layout (a photograph or a group of photographs on the wall), but try to add a slight twist to keep things interesting.
