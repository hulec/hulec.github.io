It has been interesting to see everyone and the way they react with my work. Many people have commented on the colour -  the way in which it helps to break up the images into blocks, and the presence it has in the space as a whole.

Because of the way in which these images have been clumped together, it does look almost painterly in the way it is abstract. 

The way in which the photographs have been arranged is quite literal, but I thought it showed this sense of sequence and also the "Internet of Things" in some ways. 

I am pleased with the overall result, although I think the process I used for these photographs was not efficient in any way and could have gone a lot smoother. It is one definite area for improvement.
